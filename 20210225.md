The dream starts with my mother and I trekking in the jungle, somewhere in Africa, possibly In DRC. We are wearing ski-mask-like face coverings, I’m not sure why, perhaps for the bugs or the sun.

At one point, we see what seems to be a monkey, also wearing the same kind of ski-mask covering along with some sort of hazmat suit jumping through the jungle.

This monkey is incredibly athletic, beyond anything a monkey would normally be capable of.

Eventually, we confront the monkey-creature. We realise that it is also far more intelligent than a monkey and start communicating with it via gestures.

The creature removes its masks and reveals what seems to be a larger, wider, quite malformed human head: the creature is an extraterrestrial alien.

We continue communicating and I understand that it comes from “some ugly planet in the dirt belt” that we as humans have not yet observed. I assume it means the Kuiper belt by dirt belt. Our communication is not verbal but somehow it manages to communicate this information.
It also tells us that they are here on Earth to mine some resource which we don’t quite catch.

Our encounter ends and the alien continues on its way. When we get back, my mother tells me to forget about the encounter, that we were probably hallucinating and that I should stop thinking about it. Basically she’s paranoid and wishes it never happened.

I can’t stop thinking about the encounter though, but refrain from telling anyone about it as my mother instructed. Meanwhile I keep seeing “monkey” incidents pop up on the news, with “monkeys” wreaking havoc in the jungle, particularly around mining sites of various resources. During this phase I experience some minor sleep paralysis in real life, but I internalise it as part of the dream.

The monkey-business eventually reaches the city, and it is clear that the resource these aliens were after was cocoa and chocolate in general. They manage to collect all they need, with some human casualties and property damage along the way and somehow disappear, presumably to return home.

The secret however is out, and the aliens offer human-kind to join their society, proposing to “merge our databases”, whatever that means. They assure us that the transition would be smooth since they have been preparing for this.

Since the alternative is probably a violent conquest, humanity accepts the offer and we are transferred to their planet on the Kuiper Belt. The transition is indeed smooth and within no time we are walking about the alien society.

The scenery basically looks like a gigantic shopping mall, with aesthetics reminiscent of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas mixed with some TRON-like lights. I realise that this alien culture follows the cult of money. Money is their religion.

I also realise that their offer to integrate us in their society was not because they found us interesting or had pity for us. No, they wanted us in their society because we as human kind are the ideal consumers and believers of money, being addicted to these concepts (kind of cliche, I realise. Blame my dream brain).

Finally we meet the alien leader, which is taller and is wearing a mask of a baby human face with a beard. Weird. He speaks to us for a bit and starts singing a song by Queen (I forget which one), as he reveals to us the result of their looting of Earth: a huge shiny chocolate. 

At this point my alarm went off and I woke up.
